## Introduction to Cgraph

Imagine you're a doctor trying to understand why some patients get sick and others don't. You have lots of different measurements from each patient - blood tests, genetic information, lifestyle habits, and more. How do you make sense of all this information together? This is where Cgraph comes in.

Cgraph is like a super-smart assistant that can look at all these different types of data at once and find hidden patterns and connections. It helps scientists and doctors understand how different measurements relate to each other and what they mean for a person's health.

## What is Multi-Omics Data?

### The "-Omics" Revolution

In biology, an "-omics" is a way to study all of something at once. For example:

- **Genomics**: Studies all the genes (DNA) in a person
- **Proteomics**: Looks at all the proteins in a sample
- **Metabolomics**: Examines all the small molecules (metabolites) in cells
- **Lipidomics**: Studies all the fats and lipids
- **Transcriptomics**: Looks at all the RNA molecules (which help make proteins)

Think of each "-omics" as a different layer of information about how your body works:
- Your genes are like an instruction manual
- Proteins are the workers that do most jobs in your cells
- Metabolites are the chemicals your body processes
- Lipids form cell structures and store energy

Here's how these different layers connect:
```
DNA (Genomics) → RNA (Transcriptomics) → Proteins (Proteomics)
                                        ↓
                         Metabolites (Metabolomics)
                         Lipids (Lipidomics)
```

### Why We Need Multiple Types of Data

Just looking at genes isn't enough to understand health and disease completely. For example:
- Your genes might say you're at risk for diabetes
- But your metabolites might show your blood sugar is normal
- And your lifestyle data might reveal you exercise daily

To get the full picture, we need to combine all these layers of information - that's multi-omics integration.

## The Challenge of Integrating Different Data Types

Imagine trying to combine information from:
- A written book (genes)
- A photo album (proteins)
- A music playlist (metabolites)
- A collection of recipes (lipids)
- A daily journal (lifestyle)

These are totally different formats! This is the challenge of multi-omics integration. Each "-omics" data type:
- Has different scales (some numbers are huge, others tiny)
- Contains different numbers of measurements
- Has missing values (not every measurement works for every person)
- Uses different techniques to collect data

For example, a dataset might look like this:

**Metabolomics Data (partial view):**
| Patient ID | Glucose | Cholesterol | Lactate | ... | Citrate |
|------------|---------|-------------|---------|-----|---------|
| Patient1   | 5.2     | 190         | 1.3     | ... | 0.09    |
| Patient2   | 7.1     | 210         | 1.5     | ... | 0.11    |
| Patient3   | 4.9     | 175         | ?       | ... | 0.08    |

**Proteomics Data (partial view):**
| Patient ID | Protein1 | Protein2 | Protein3 | ... | Protein200 |
|------------|----------|----------|----------|-----|------------|
| Patient1   | 0.56     | 1.23     | 0.89     | ... | 0.45       |
| Patient2   | ?        | 0.98     | 1.45     | ... | 0.32       |
| Patient4   | 0.47     | 1.05     | 0.92     | ... | ?          |

Notice how some values are missing (marked with ?), and not every patient has measurements in both datasets.

## Graphs: A Way to Connect Everything

### What is a Graph?

In computer science, a "graph" isn't like a chart or plot. Instead, it's a collection of:
- **Nodes** (also called vertices): These are the individual points or objects
- **Edges**: These are the connections or relationships between nodes

Think of a social network:
- Each person is a node
- Friendships are the edges connecting people

A simple graph might look like this:

```
   A --- B
   |     |
   |     |
   C --- D
```

Where A, B, C, and D are nodes, and the lines between them are edges.

### Heterogeneous Graphs

Cgraph uses a special type of graph called a "heterogeneous graph" where there are different types of nodes and connections:
- **Participant nodes**: Representing individual people
- **Feature nodes**: Representing individual measurements (like a specific protein or metabolite)
- Different types of connections showing how participants relate to features and how features relate to each other

A simplified heterogeneous graph might look like this:

```
                  Metabolite1
                /    |
               /     |
Participant1 ---- Protein1
               \     |
                \    |
                  Metabolite2
```

In this simple example, Participant1 is connected to various features (Protein1, Metabolite1, Metabolite2), and the features themselves are connected if they're related.

### Why Graphs Are Perfect for Multi-Omics

Graphs allow us to:
1. Represent different types of data in one structure
2. Show both direct and indirect relationships
3. Handle missing data effectively
4. Discover complex patterns across different data types

## The Cgraph Pipeline: Step by Step

Cgraph processes multi-omics data through a series of steps:

### 1. Data Loading

First, Cgraph takes data files containing different types of measurements:
- Metabolomics data
- Proteomics data
- Biochemistry data
- Lifestyle data
- Lipidomics data

Each file has measurements for multiple participants (people in the study), with each row representing one person and columns representing different measurements.

The code for loading data looks like this (simplified):

```python
# Load different data types
modalities, availability_df = load_multi_omics_data(
    metabolomics_file="data/metabolomics.csv",
    proteomics_file="data/proteomics.csv",
    biochemistry_file="data/biochemistry.csv",
    lifestyle_file="data/lifestyle.csv",
    lipidomics_file="data/lipidomics.csv"
)
```

### 2. Preprocessing and Standardization

Raw biological data needs cleaning to be useful:
- **Standardization**: Adjusting values so they're comparable (like converting different units to the same scale)
- **Handling extreme values**: Addressing unusually high or low measurements
- **Transformations**: Mathematical adjustments to make the data easier to analyze

For example, if one measurement ranges from 0-1 and another from 1000-5000, we might transform them both to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, making them directly comparable.

### 3. Missing Data Imputation

In real-world studies, not every measurement is successful for every person. Cgraph uses a special technique called "graph-based imputation" to make educated guesses about missing values:
- It finds participants who are similar based on available data
- It uses these similarities to estimate missing values
- This is similar to how Netflix might recommend movies based on people with similar tastes

For example, if Patient1 and Patient2 have very similar protein measurements, and Patient1 is missing a metabolite value that Patient2 has, we can use Patient2's value as a good estimate.

### 4. Building the Multi-Omics Graph

This is where the magic happens! Cgraph creates a complex network that connects everything:
- **Participant nodes**: Each person in the study
- **Feature nodes**: Each individual measurement (protein levels, metabolite concentrations, etc.)
- **Participant-feature edges**: Connecting people to their measurements
- **Feature-feature edges**: Connecting measurements that are related to each other
- **Cross-modality edges**: Special connections between different types of measurements that might be biologically related

The graph captures relationships like:
- Which measurements are highly correlated
- Which features tend to appear together
- How different types of measurements might influence each other

A simplified representation of the heterogeneous graph might look like this:

```
                       Metabolite1 ----- Metabolite2
                      /   |           /       |
                     /    |          /        |
                    /     |         /         |
Participant1 ----- Protein1        /          |
                    \     |       /           |
                     \    |      /            |
                      \   |     /             |
Participant2 ---------- Protein2 ---------- Metabolite3
```

### 5. Training the Graph Neural Network

Cgraph uses a special type of artificial intelligence called a Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) to learn from this complex network. This AI is inspired by the same technology that powers advanced language models like ChatGPT, but adapted for biological data.

The system learns:
- How to create "embeddings" (compact representations) of each participant and feature
- How features from different data types relate to each other
- Which measurements are most important for understanding the overall patterns

The HGT model uses multiple layers of "attention" to focus on important connections in the graph.

### 6. Analysis and Visualization

Once the model is trained, Cgraph can:
- Visualize patterns in the data
- Find similar participants
- Identify which data types (metabolomics, proteomics, etc.) provide the most useful information
- Discover relationships between different types of measurements

For example, we might visualize how participants cluster based on their embeddings:

```
                    x        x
                  x   x    x   x
                 x     x  x     x
                x       xx       x
Group A →      x         x         x ← Group B
                x       xx       x
                 x     x  x     x
                  x   x    x   x
                    x        x
```

Where each "x" represents a participant, and we can see two clear groups emerging from the data.

## How Cgraph Learns from Data

### Embeddings: Capturing Meaning in Numbers

One of the key concepts in Cgraph is "embeddings" - these are like compact summaries that capture the essence of complex information.

Imagine you wanted to describe different animals. Instead of listing all their features (number of legs, presence of fur, ability to fly, etc.), you could place them in a 2D space where:
- Similar animals are close together
- Different animals are far apart

This is what embeddings do - they represent complex objects (like participants or biological measurements) as points in a mathematical space where the distances and directions have meaning.

For example, after creating embeddings, we might see:
- All diabetes patients clustered in one region
- All heart disease patients in another
- And healthy people in a third region

### Attention Mechanisms: Focusing on What Matters

Cgraph uses "attention mechanisms" inspired by how humans focus on important information:
- When you read a sentence, you pay more attention to key words
- When a doctor examines test results, they focus on abnormal values

The Heterogeneous Graph Transformer in Cgraph learns which connections in the graph are most important for understanding the patterns in the data. It "pays attention" to the most informative relationships.

For example, when trying to understand diabetes, the model might learn to pay special attention to:
- Glucose levels in metabolomics data
- Insulin-related proteins in proteomics data
- Body mass index in lifestyle data

### Learning Across Modalities

The most powerful aspect of Cgraph is its ability to learn connections between different types of data:
- It might discover that a certain gene variant (genomics) relates to levels of a specific protein (proteomics)
- Or that certain metabolites (metabolomics) are associated with particular lifestyle factors

These cross-modality insights are often the most valuable discoveries, as they help explain the complex interactions in biological systems.

## Technical Deep Dive: The Math Behind Cgraph

For those interested in the technical details, here's a deeper look at how Cgraph works:

### Graph Construction Mathematics

The heterogeneous graph is built using correlation and similarity measures:

1. **Participant-Feature Edges**: Direct connections based on measured values
2. **Feature-Feature Edges**: Created when the correlation between features exceeds a threshold:
   
   Correlation(feature1, feature2) > threshold

3. **Cross-Modality Edges**: Similar to feature-feature edges, but between different data types

### Heterogeneous Graph Transformer

The HGT model works with the following components:

1. **Node Type-Specific Projections**: Each type of node (participant, metabolite, protein, etc.) gets its own projection matrix to convert raw features into a common embedding space

2. **Multi-Head Attention**: For each node, the model computes attention scores across its neighbors:
   
   Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d) × V
   
   Where Q (query), K (key), and V (value) are transformations of the node embeddings

3. **Layer Normalization and Residual Connections**: Similar to modern transformer architectures, ensuring stable training

4. **Message Passing**: Information flows through the graph via multiple layers of computation, allowing distant nodes to influence each other

### Loss Function and Training

The model is trained using a combination of:
- Reconstruction loss (how well the embeddings can reconstruct the original data)
- Link prediction loss (how well the model predicts connections between nodes)

The final objective function is:
```
L = Lreconstruction + λ × Llink_prediction
```

Where λ is a weighting factor.

## Applications and Benefits

Cgraph can help with many important scientific and medical tasks:

### Personalized Medicine

By analyzing patterns across multiple types of data, Cgraph can help:
- Identify subtypes of diseases that need different treatments
- Predict which patients will respond to which medications
- Understand individual risk factors for diseases

For example, breast cancer used to be treated as one disease, but multi-omics studies have revealed multiple subtypes with different genetic patterns, protein expressions, and metabolic profiles - each needing different treatments.

### Biomarker Discovery

Biomarkers are measurements that indicate something important about health. Cgraph can:
- Find combinations of measurements that predict disease better than single tests
- Discover which measurements from easy tests (like blood samples) correlate with more invasive or expensive tests

For instance, instead of an invasive brain scan to diagnose Alzheimer's disease, a combination of blood proteins and metabolites might provide an early warning.

### Understanding Disease Mechanisms

By connecting different types of biological data, Cgraph helps scientists understand:
- How diseases develop at multiple biological levels
- Which processes are most disrupted in different conditions
- The complex chain of events leading to symptoms

This helps answer questions like: "Does a genetic mutation cause disease by changing protein production, altering metabolism, or both?"

### Drug Development

Cgraph can assist pharmaceutical research by:
- Identifying potential drug targets across multiple biological systems
- Predicting potential side effects by examining wide-ranging biological impacts
- Finding patient groups most likely to benefit from specific treatments

## Real-World Example: From Raw Data to Insights

Let's walk through a simplified example of how Cgraph processes data:

### Starting Data

We begin with data from 100 participants, with measurements across different modalities:
- Metabolomics: 100 metabolites measured
- Proteomics: 200 proteins measured
- Lifestyle: 30 lifestyle factors recorded

Each participant has some missing values, and 3 distinct participant groups exist in the data (though we don't know this yet).

### The Cgraph Process

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Standardize all measurements
   - Handle outliers and transform skewed distributions

2. **Missing Value Imputation**:
   - Create a similarity network between participants
   - Use the network to estimate missing values

3. **Graph Construction**:
   - Create a graph with 100 participant nodes and 330 feature nodes
   - Add ~20,000 participant-feature edges
   - Add ~5,000 feature-feature edges based on correlations
   - Add ~1,000 cross-modality edges connecting related features from different data types

4. **Model Training**:
   - Train the HGT model on the graph
   - Generate embeddings for all nodes

5. **Analysis**:
   - Visualize participant embeddings, revealing 3 distinct clusters
   - Evaluate feature importance, finding that 5 metabolites and 3 proteins are the most distinguishing features between groups
   - Discover previously unknown connections between specific proteins and metabolites

### The Insight

After analysis, we learn that:
- The three clusters represent distinct disease subtypes
- Each subtype has a unique signature across multiple data types
- A specific protein-metabolite interaction appears to drive the differences
- This interaction suggests a new treatment target that wouldn't have been found by looking at any single data type
